In this project, we implement an assembler.
This is the first project in the nand2tetris book that focuses on developing the software hierarchy, rather than the hardware
platform. I have chosen to implement in python.
The assembler takes an assembly (.asm) file as input and returns a binary (.hack) file as output.
