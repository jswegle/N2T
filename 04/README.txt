Exercise in writing assembly code, which is then fed into the hardware platform created in the first 3 chapters. 
My work is written in the .asm files. The other files are either test files, or files to compare my outputs to.
I've added the additional files to illustrated what the result should look like, but without the underlying hardware 
they are useless.
