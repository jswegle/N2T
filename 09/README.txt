In this chapter, the specs for the Jack language are explained. Instead of building something using python, in this chapter we 
write a few simple programs in the Jack to internalize its syntax. These jack files can then be fed into the virtual machine
to be turned into assembly code, which can then be run on the hardware created in the first 5 chapters.
All Jack programs are saved as .jack files.
